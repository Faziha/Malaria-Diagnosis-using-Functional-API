# Malaria-Diagnosis-using-Functional-API
Malaria Diagnosis using Functional API

In this code we have trained more advanced model with tensorflow, previously we used Sequential API but this time we have used functional API for this purpose 
Functional API is more efficient as compared to sequential API
beacuse it provides us the advantages of shared layers 
This time we have talked about 2 outputs
1- Detection of effected or uneffected
2- Exact position of cells
